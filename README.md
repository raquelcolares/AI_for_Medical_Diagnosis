# AI for Medical Diagnosis

AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments.

- **Week 1** - Disease Detection with Computer Vision
  
  Practice classifying diseases on chest x-rays using a neural network.
